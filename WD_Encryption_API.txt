PASSWORD LENGTH field

The PASSWORD LENGTH field contain the length of password used on drive.
Password is binary blob of specified size. The size is expressed in bytes. 
It is 16B for AES 128 cipher suite and 32B for AES 256 cipher suite and FDE.

KEY RESET ENABLER field

The KEY RESET ENABLER field is four byte code required for subsequent
RESET DATA ENCRYPTION KEY command. Such command needs to be called
immediatelly as code changes with any command issued on device.

NUMBER OF CIPHERS and CIPHER n

The NUMBER OF CIPHERS and CIPHER n fields describe th elist of encryption
alghoritms supported by the device. For description of CIPHER i field see
table 4.

 =========================================================================

1.2 UNLOCK ENCRYPTION(10) command

The UNLOCK ENCRYPTION(10) command (see table 5) provides a means for an
application to supply the password that unlock the drive encryption key. 

The security status needs to be 1 (LOCKED, see table 3) otherwise command
will be terminated with CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST, and additional sense code set to 74h/81h (if security 
status 0, 2 or 7) or 74h/80h (if security status 06h).

If security status is 1, the supplied password is used to unlock internal
encryption key. For the format of command parameter block see table 6.

If unlock attempt is unsuccesfull, command will be terminated with 
CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and 
additional sense code set to AUTHENTICATION FAILED (74h/40h).  Number of
unsuccesfull attempt is incremented. 

If number of unsucesfull attempts exceed an internal limit, secure status 
become 6 and no further unlock attempts are allowed.  Either power off/on
transition or RESET DATA ENCRYPTION KEY is required to solve it.

On succesfull unlock the security status of device become 2 (UNLOCKED) .

Unless unlocked, access to most common commands including reading and
writting a sector of drive or format is not allowed. Those commands are
terminated with CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set to DATA PROTECT,
and additional sense code set to LOGICAL UNIT ACCESS NOT AUTHORIZED 
(74h/71h).

SIGNATURE field

The SIGNATURE field is 45h all the times

PASSWORD LENGTH and PASSWORD fields

The PASSWORD LENGTH field contain the length of password used on drive.
The size is expressed in bytes. PASSWORD field is binary blob of specified
size. The size is expressed in bytes. 

The size of password is not user selectable it must be exactly the same as
specified by the drive in PASSWORD LENGTH field of response to 
ENCRYPTION STATUS command or command will be terminated with CHECK CONDITION 
status, with sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and  additional sense code
set to INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER LIST (26h/00h).

 =========================================================================

1.3 CHANGE ENCRYPTION PASSPHRASE(10) command

The CHANGE ENCRYPTION PASSPHRASE(10) command (see table 7) provides 
a means for an application to change the password that unlock the drive 
encryption key. It can be used to enable and disable password security as
well.

"Disabled password security" mean that security status is 0 and password 
needs not to be supplied by application to access the drive. See table 3 for
more information.

The security status needs to be 2 (UNLOCKED, see table 3) for password
change and disable security operations and 0 (NotProtected) for enable 
security operation. If drive is not in expected state the command
will be terminated with CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST, and additional sense code set to 74h/81h (if security 
status 0, 2 or 7) or 74h/80h (if security status 06h).

For password change and disable security operations the old password is
required. If password is not correct, command will be terminated with 
CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and 
additional sense code set to AUTHENTICATION FAILED (74h/40h).  Number of
unsuccesfull attempt is incremented. 

If number of unsucesfull attempts exceed an internal limit, drive's secure 
status become 6 and no further change encryption passphrase nor unlock attempts 
are allowed.  Either power off/on transition or RESET DATA ENCRYPTION KEY 
is required to solve it.

For the format of command parameter block see table 8.

If old password is correct or "enable security" operation is requested, the
new password si installed in the drive. Security status of device become 
2 (UNLOCKED) for password change and enable security operations or 
0 (NotProtected) for disable security operation.

SIGNATURE field

The SIGNATURE field is 45h all the times

OLDDEF bit

The OLDDEF bit is set to 1 then OLD PASSWORD content is ignored and vendor
specific default password is used instead. It is used for "enable security"
operation.

NEWDEF bit

The NEWDEF bit is set to 1 then NEW PASSWORD content is ignored and vendor
specific default password is used instead. It is used for "disable security"
operation. Both NEWDEF and OLDDEF must not be set to 1 at the same time or 
command will be terminated with CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set 
to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and additional sense code set to 
INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER LIST (26h/00h).

PASSWORD LENGTH, OLD PASSWORD and NEW PASSWORD fields

The PASSWORD LENGTH field contain the length of password used on drive.
The size is expressed in bytes. OLD PASSWORD and NEW PASSWORD fields 
are binary blob of specified size. The size is expressed in bytes. 

The size of password is not user selectable it must be exactly the same as
specified by the drive in PASSWORD LENGTH field of response to 
ENCRYPTION STATUS command or command will be terminated with CHECK CONDITION 
status, with sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and  additional sense code
set to INVALID FIELD IN PARAMETER LIST (26h/00h).

 =========================================================================

1.4 RESET DATA ENCRYPTION KEY(10) command

The RESET DATA ENCRYPTION KEY(10) command (see table 9) enforce drive to
generate new data encryption key. As old key become lost, the encrypted data
stored on medium are not changed but can't be decrypted anymore.

Command can be called in any security state. It's intended to solve "lost
user password" condition or change internal encryption alghoritm or just to
quickly make all data on medium inaccesible.

Reset Data Encryption Key command doesn't change data stored on the medium, 
but they can't be decrypted anymore as old encryption key become lost.

New Encryption key is scrambled by vendor specific password and not supplied
outside of the device, security state of device become 0 (NotProtected).

Reset Data Encryption Key command is protected against unintended invocation
by KEY RESET ENABLER field. The ENCRYPTION STATUS command needs to be called
just before RESET DATA ENCRYPTION KEY command to obtain valid code (see
table 2). If no valid code filled then command will be terminated with 
CHECK CONDITION status, with sense key set to ILLEGAL REQUEST, and additional
sense code set to INVALID FIELD IN CDB (24h/00h).

For the format of command parameter block see table 10.

2.3 Return All Pages Page (3Fh)

Note that standard  MODE SENSE Return All Pages command seems to have
off-by-one bug in some firmware versions. It report +1 size on list of
returned pages, so the latest reported page is random number. It doesn't
affect common drive operations in any way.

 =========================================================================

3. *** WD UTILITIES specific API (software)

 =========================================================================

The drive itself use password in the form of binary blob of fixed length
(16B for AES 128 ciphers, 32B for AES 256 ciphers and FDE). It's necesarry to
transform user's text input into that form. Such transform  needs to be
consistent accross utilities or resulting password blob will not be same and
unlock operation will fail. Current WD Utilities use salted sha256 hash to 
compute password blob from user input for AES 256 and FDE. AES 128 drives
are unsupported by current version of WD Utilities, so WD standard alghoritm
is not known for AES 128 suite.

All string operations (e.g. user input and hash) are done in UCS-2
(little-endian) encoding.

The pseudo code of alghoritm used in WD Utilities:

1. STR = CONCAT(SALT, UPW)
2. FOR i=1 TO i==ITERATION_COUNT DO STR = sha256Digest(STR)
3. RETURN (STR)

Where UPW is password as entered by user
SALT is salt prepended to such password for the purpose of digest
calculation
ITERATION_COUNT is the number of times the sha256Digest is applied to string

On exit STR contain password blob used for password operations on drive

Based on exact version and platform of WD Utilities, the SALT and ITERATION_COUNT
are either hardcoded in the code or stored in Security Block (drive's Handy Store
block 1). In the first case, the SALT of "WDC." is used and ITERATION COUNT
is 1000. In the second case, stored data are used for password blob
calculation. Vendor specific READ HANDY STORE(10) command should be used to 
read Security Block from drive. Hardcoded default Salt and Iteration Count will
be used if no Security Block foun on drive.

Even if stored SALT and ITERATION COUNT are honored by WD
utilities for the purpose of password blob calculation, they are rewritten
to defaults on first password change.

3.1 Security Block (drive's Handy Store block 1)

ITERATION COUNT field
The Interation Count field hold the number of digest operation applied on
salted user password string.

SALT and HINTS fields

The SALT and HINTS fields are UCS-2 little endian encoded strings. The first
one is uset as salt in process of password blob calculation. The second one
is just hint for the user to help him to enter password. Such arbitrary string has
no meaning for drive nor WD utilities beyond it can be displayed to user.

CHECKSUM field

The CHECKSUM field is used to verify the validity of the block. Sum of all
bytes in the block needs to be zero or block is considered invalid. Note
that it seems that some version of WD utilities count first byte of sector
twice as accident. As it is 0x00 it doesn't broke the result

NOTE 1: Hardware is not tied to alghoritm used by WD Utilities nor the
content of Handy Store Block 1 (Security Block). It's possible to implement
different alghoritm and maintain the drive using it. Of course, vendor's WD
utilities will not be able to maintain such disc at the same time.

NOTE 2: Alghoritm described above is used on drives set to AES 256 suite of
ciphers and for FDE. AES 128 suite is not supported by current WD utilities, 
thus there is no "standard vendor alghoritm" used to calculate password blob
known for such drives.

3.2 User Block (drive's Handy Store block 2)

Independent device label can be set and is recognized by WD Utilities in User
Block (Handy Store Block 2). For format of such block see table 18. Vendor
